**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Network Traffic Spike on EC2 Instance

Alert: Network traffic on EC2 instance <instance_id> has spiked above 100 Mbps for the last 15 minutes.
```

**Problem Description:**
A sudden spike in network traffic on an EC2 instance can indicate unexpected activity or potential network-based attacks.

**Solution:**
1. **Investigate Traffic Source:** Use VPC Flow Logs or network monitoring tools to identify the source and destination of the increased network traffic.
2. **Implement Security Measures:** Implement security measures such as network access control lists (ACLs) or security groups to restrict unauthorized network traffic.

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - EC2 Instance Status Check Failed

Alert: Instance status check failed for EC2 instance <instance_id>.
```

**Problem Description:**
Failed instance status checks indicate potential hardware issues, network connectivity problems, or underlying hypervisor issues.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Instance Console Output:** Review the console output of the instance for any error messages or warnings that may provide clues about the cause of the failure.
2. **Reboot Instance:** Attempt to reboot the instance to see if it resolves the status check failure.
3. **Check System Logs:** Review system logs and CloudWatch logs for any indications of hardware failures, network issues, or software errors.
4. **Contact AWS Support:** If the issue persists or cannot be resolved, contact AWS support for assistance in diagnosing and resolving the problem.

**Alert Scenario 5: EC2 Instance Disk Space Running Low**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Low Disk Space on EC2 Instance

Alert: Disk space on EC2 instance <instance_id> has fallen below 10% for the last 20 minutes.
```

**Problem Description:**
Low disk space on an EC2 instance can lead to service disruptions, failure to write logs, or inability to store data.

**Solution:**
1. **Identify Disk Usage:** Use CloudWatch metrics or EC2 instance monitoring tools to identify which volumes or directories are consuming the most disk space.
2. **Cleanup Unused Data:** Remove unnecessary files, logs, or temporary files to free up disk space.
3. **Resize EBS Volume:** Resize the EBS volume attached to the instance to increase its storage capacity if vertical scaling is feasible and necessary.
4. **Set CloudWatch Alarms:** Set up CloudWatch alarms to trigger notifications when disk space utilization exceeds predefined thresholds.

**Alert Scenario 6: EC2 Instance Unreachable**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - EC2 Instance Unreachable

Alert: EC2 instance <instance_id> is unreachable from the public internet.
```

**Problem Description:**
An EC2 instance becoming unreachable from the public internet can indicate network configuration issues, security group misconfigurations, or instance failures.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Security Group Rules:** Review the security group rules associated with the instance to ensure that inbound and outbound traffic is allowed as expected.
2. **Verify Network ACLs:** Check network ACLs associated with the subnet to ensure that they are not blocking traffic to or from the instance.
3. **Check Instance State:** Verify that the instance is in a running state and has not been stopped or terminated accidentally.
4. **Review VPC Routing:** Ensure that the instance is attached to a subnet with the appropriate route tables and internet gateway (if applicable) for internet access.

**Alert Scenario 7: EC2 Instance Auto Recovery Triggered**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - EC2 Instance Auto Recovery Triggered

Alert: Auto recovery has been triggered for EC2 instance <instance_id>.
```

**Problem Description:**
Auto recovery is triggered by AWS when a system status check or instance status check fails repeatedly, indicating potential underlying hardware issues.

**Solution:**
1. **Review System Logs:** Review system logs and CloudWatch logs to identify any hardware failures or issues that may have triggered the auto recovery.
2. **Check Instance Health:** Verify the health of the instance after it has been recovered to ensure that it is functioning properly.
3. **Investigate Root Cause:** Investigate the root cause of the status check failures and take corrective actions to prevent recurrence, such as instance resizing or contacting AWS support.

**Alert Scenario 8: EC2 Instance Security Group Rule Changes**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Security Group Rule Changes on EC2 Instance

Alert: Security group rules for EC2 instance <instance_id> have been modified.
```

**Problem Description:**
Changes to security group rules can indicate unauthorized access attempts, misconfigurations, or intentional modifications to network access controls.

**Solution:**
1. **Review Security Group Changes:** Review the changes made to the security group rules to understand the scope and impact of the modifications.
2. **Verify Intent:** Verify whether the changes were made intentionally and align with security best practices and organizational policies.
3. **Revert Unauthorized Changes:** If unauthorized changes are detected, revert the security group rules to their previous state and investigate the source of the unauthorized modifications.
4. **Monitor Security Group Changes:** Implement monitoring and auditing of security group changes to detect and respond to unauthorized modifications proactively.

```
Subject: ALERT - EC2 Instance Spot Termination Notice

Alert: EC2 instance <instance_id> has received a spot termination notice and will be terminated in 2 minutes.
```

**Problem Description:**
Spot instances can be terminated by AWS with short notice when the spot price exceeds the maximum bid price, leading to potential service disruptions.

**Solution:**
1. **Handle Termination Gracefully:** Configure applications running on spot instances to handle termination gracefully, such as draining connections or persisting state externally.
2. **Implement Spot Instance Strategies:** Use strategies such as spot fleet diversification or spot instance pools to minimize the impact of spot instance terminations.
3. **Adjust Bid Price:** Monitor spot instance prices and adjust bid prices as necessary to avoid frequent terminations while balancing cost optimization.
