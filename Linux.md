**Alert Scenario 1: High CPU Usage**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - High CPU Usage on Server XYZ

Alert: The CPU usage on Server XYZ has exceeded 90%.
```

**Problem Description:**
The server's CPU is under heavy load, which may lead to performance degradation and unresponsiveness of applications.

**Solution:**
1. **Identify the Process:** Use the `top` command to identify the processes consuming the most CPU.
   ```bash
   top
   ```
2. **Analyze CPU Usage:** Analyze the output of `top` to determine which process or processes are causing the high CPU usage.
3. **Kill or Optimize Processes:** Once identified, consider optimizing the offending processes or, if necessary, terminating them using the `kill` command.
   ```bash
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

**Alert Scenario 2: High Memory Usage**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - High Memory Usage on Server XYZ

Alert: The memory usage on Server XYZ has exceeded 90%.
```

**Problem Description:**
Server's memory resources are heavily utilized, potentially leading to swapping, which can degrade system performance.

**Solution:**
1. **Identify Memory Hogs:** Use the `top` or `htop` command to identify processes consuming the most memory.
   ```bash
   top
   ```
2. **Analyze Memory Usage:** Analyze the output to identify the processes consuming excessive memory.
3. **Optimize or Kill Processes:** Optimize memory-consuming processes where possible, or terminate them if necessary using the `kill` command.
   ```bash
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

**Alert Scenario 3: Disk Space Exhaustion**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Disk Space Exhaustion on Server XYZ

```

**Problem Description:**
The server's disk space is nearly full, which can cause issues with logging, application crashes, or inability to write data.

**Solution:**
1. **Identify Disk Usage:** Use the `df` command to identify which filesystems are running out of space.
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```
2. **Find Large Files:** Use `du` command to find large files or directories consuming disk space.
   ```bash
   du -sh * | sort -hr
   ```

**Alert Scenario 4: Network Connectivity Issues**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Network Connectivity Issues on Server XYZ

Alert: Server XYZ is experiencing intermittent network connectivity problems.
```

**Problem Description:**
The server is having trouble maintaining stable network connections, which can impact communication with other servers or services.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Network Interface Status:** Use the `ifconfig` or `ip` command to check the status of network interfaces.
   ```bash
   ifconfig
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   ip addr show
   ```
2. **Check Network Configuration:** Review network configuration files (`/etc/network/interfaces` or `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface>`) for any misconfigurations.
3. **Check Connectivity:** Test network connectivity using tools like `ping` or `traceroute` to identify where the connectivity issues lie.
   ```bash
   ping google.com
   ```

**Alert Scenario 5: High Disk I/O**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - High Disk I/O on Server XYZ

Alert: Server XYZ is experiencing high disk I/O.
```

**Problem Description:**
The server's disk I/O usage is high, potentially leading to slow disk response times or application performance issues.

**Solution:**
1. **Identify Processes:** Use tools like `iotop` to identify processes causing high disk I/O.
   ```bash
   iotop
   ```
2. **Investigate Disk Usage:** Check which files or directories are being heavily accessed using `iotop` or `atop`.
3. **Optimize or Throttle Processes:** Optimize disk-intensive processes where possible, or implement disk I/O throttling.

**Alert Scenario 6: Service Unavailability**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Service Unavailability on Server XYZ

Alert: Service <service_name> on Server XYZ is unavailable.
```

**Problem Description:**
A critical service on the server is down or unresponsive, affecting user access or application functionality.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Service Status:** Use the `systemctl status` command to check the status of the service.
   ```bash
   systemctl status <service_name>
   ```
2. **Review Logs:** Check service-specific logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate the cause of the service failure.
   ```bash
   journalctl -u <service_name>
   ```
3. **Restart Service:** If the service is stopped, restart it using the `systemctl` command.
   ```bash
   systemctl restart <service_name>
   ```

**Alert Scenario 7: High Load Average**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - High Load Average on Server XYZ

Alert: The load average on Server XYZ has exceeded the threshold.
```

**Problem Description:**
The server's load average is high, indicating a high number of processes in the run queue, which could lead to performance degradation.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Load Average:** Use the `uptime` command to check the load average of the server.
   ```bash
   uptime
   ```
2. **Identify CPU Intensive Processes:** Use `top` or `htop` to identify processes causing high CPU usage.
3. **Optimize or Kill Processes:** Optimize CPU-intensive processes or consider terminating unnecessary processes using the `kill` command.

**Alert Scenario 8: SSH Login Attempts**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - SSH Login Attempts on Server XYZ

Alert: Server XYZ is experiencing multiple failed SSH login attempts.
```

**Problem Description:**
The server is being targeted by unauthorized login attempts, potentially indicating a security threat.

**Solution:**
1. **Review Authentication Logs:** Check the `/var/log/auth.log` or `/var/log/secure` file for failed login attempts.
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/auth.log
   ```
2. **Block IPs:** If necessary, block the IP addresses of the offending hosts using tools like `iptables` or `fail2ban`.
   ```bash
   iptables -A INPUT -s <IP_address> -j DROP
   ```
3. **Strengthen Authentication:** Consider implementing measures such as SSH key authentication, strong passwords, or two-factor authentication.

**Alert Scenario 9: Disk Read/Write Errors**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Disk Read/Write Errors on Server XYZ

Alert: Server XYZ has detected disk read/write errors on disk <disk_name>.
```

**Problem Description:**
The server has encountered errors while reading from or writing to a disk, indicating potential hardware or filesystem issues.

**Solution:**
1. **Check SMART Status:** Use the `smartctl` command to check the SMART status of the disk for any signs of failure.
   ```bash
   smartctl -a /dev/<disk_name>
   ```
2. **Check Filesystem:** Run filesystem consistency checks using tools like `fsck` to identify and repair any filesystem errors.
   ```bash
   fsck /dev/<disk_partition>
   ```
3. **Replace Faulty Disk:** If the disk is failing, replace it with a new one and restore data from backups if necessary.

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Excessive Process Forks on Server XYZ

Alert: Server XYZ is experiencing excessive process forks.
```

**Problem Description:**
The server is creating an unusually high number of processes, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or instability.

**Solution:**
1. **Identify Processes:** Use tools like `ps` or `htop` to identify processes responsible for excessive forking.
   ```bash
   ps auxf
   ```
2. **Investigate Cause:** Review application code or system configuration to identify the cause of excessive process creation.
3. **Optimize Processes:** Optimize code or configuration to reduce unnecessary process forking and improve resource utilization.
