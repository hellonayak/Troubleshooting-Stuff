**Alert Scenario 1: Container Resource Exhaustion**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Resource Exhaustion in Docker Container on Server XYZ

Alert: Docker container <container_name> on Server XYZ has exceeded its resource limits.
```

**Problem Description:**
A Docker container is consuming more CPU, memory, or other resources than its allocated limits, potentially causing performance degradation.

**Solution:**
1. **Identify Resource Hog:** Use `docker stats` or `docker top` to identify which container is consuming excessive resources.
   ```bash
   docker stats <container_name>
   ```
2. **Adjust Resource Limits:** Increase resource limits for the container in the Docker Compose file or Docker command.
   ```yaml
   docker update --cpus <cpu_limit> --memory <memory_limit> <container_name>
   ```
3. **Optimize Container:** Optimize the application running inside the container to reduce resource usage if possible.

**Alert Scenario 2: Container Crash**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Container Crash on Server XYZ

Alert: Docker container <container_name> on Server XYZ has crashed.
```

**Problem Description:**
A Docker container has unexpectedly stopped running, potentially due to application errors or resource constraints.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Container Status:** Use `docker ps -a` to check the status of all containers, including stopped ones.
   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```
2. **Review Container Logs:** Inspect the logs of the crashed container for any error messages or exceptions.
   ```bash
   docker logs <container_name>
   ```
3. **Restart Container:** Restart the container using the `docker restart` command.
   ```bash
   docker restart <container_name>
   ```

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Docker Daemon Unresponsive on Server XYZ

Alert: The Docker daemon on Server XYZ is unresponsive.
```

**Problem Description:**
The Docker daemon, responsible for managing containers, is not responding to commands or requests.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Docker Daemon Status:** Use `systemctl status docker` or `docker info` to check the status of the Docker daemon.
   ```bash
   systemctl status docker
   ```
2. **Restart Docker Service:** Restart the Docker service to attempt to restore functionality.
   ```bash
   systemctl restart docker
   ```
3. **Review System Logs:** Inspect system logs (`/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages`) for any errors related to the Docker daemon.

**Alert Scenario 4: Container Network Issues**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Network Issues in Docker Container on Server XYZ

Alert: Docker container <container_name> on Server XYZ is experiencing network connectivity problems.
```

**Problem Description:**
The Docker container is unable to establish or maintain network connections, potentially impacting communication with other services or resources.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Container Network Settings:** Use `docker inspect` to review the network configuration of the container.
   ```bash
   docker inspect <container_name> | grep -i network
   ```
2. **Check Host Network:** Ensure that the host server's network interface is operational and correctly configured.
3. **Restart Container:** Restart the container to attempt to resolve any network-related issues.
   ```bash
   docker restart <container_name>
   ```

**Alert Scenario 5: Image Pull Failure**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Docker Image Pull Failure on Server XYZ

Alert: Docker image pull failed on Server XYZ for image <image_name>.
```

**Problem Description:**
The Docker daemon is unable to pull the specified image from the configured registry, preventing container creation or update.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Image Availability:** Verify that the specified image exists in the configured Docker registry or repository.
2. **Check Registry Authentication:** Ensure that the Docker daemon has appropriate credentials to access the registry.
3. **Retry Pull:** Attempt to pull the image again using the `docker pull` command.
   ```bash
   docker pull <image_name>
   ```

**Alert Scenario 6: Docker Container Security Vulnerability**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Security Vulnerability Detected in Docker Container on Server XYZ

Alert: Docker container <container_name> on Server XYZ is running a version with known security vulnerabilities.
```

**Problem Description:**
The Docker container is running an image version with known security vulnerabilities, potentially exposing the system to security risks.

**Solution:**
1. **Identify Vulnerable Image:** Use vulnerability scanning tools like Trivy or Clair to identify vulnerabilities in Docker images.
2. **Update Image:** Pull an updated version of the Docker image that addresses the security vulnerabilities.
3. **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly monitor for security updates and patch vulnerabilities in Docker images and containers.

**Alert Scenario 7: Docker Volume Usage**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - High Disk Usage in Docker Volume on Server XYZ

Alert: Disk space usage in Docker volume <volume_name> on Server XYZ has exceeded the threshold.
```

**Problem Description:**
The Docker volume is running out of disk space, potentially causing issues with data storage or application functionality.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Volume Usage:** Use `docker volume inspect` to check the disk space usage of the Docker volume.
   ```bash
   docker volume inspect <volume_name>
   ```
2. **Cleanup Unused Data:** Remove any unused or unnecessary data stored in the Docker volume to free up disk space.
3. **Resize Volume:** If possible, resize the Docker volume to increase its capacity.
   ```bash
   docker volume resize <volume_name> <new_size>
   ```

**Alert Scenario 8: Container Restart Loop**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Container Restart Loop Detected on Server XYZ

Alert: Docker container <container_name> on Server XYZ is continuously restarting.
```

**Problem Description:**
The Docker container is stuck in a restart loop, repeatedly crashing and restarting without successfully running.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Container Logs:** Inspect the logs of the container to identify the cause of the restart loop.
   ```bash
   docker logs <container_name>
   ```
2. **Fix Application Errors:** Address any application errors or misconfigurations that are causing the container to crash.
3. **Adjust Restart Policies:** Adjust the Docker container's restart policies to limit the number of restart attempts or to prevent automatic restarts.
   ```bash
   docker update --restart=unless-stopped <container_name>
   ```

**Alert Scenario 9: Orphaned Docker Resources**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Orphaned Docker Resources Found on Server XYZ

Alert: Orphaned Docker resources (containers, volumes, networks) found on Server XYZ.
```

**Problem Description:**
Unused or orphaned Docker resources (containers, volumes, networks) are consuming disk space and potentially causing clutter in the Docker environment.

**Solution:**
1. **Identify Orphaned Resources:** Use Docker commands like `docker ps -a`, `docker volume ls`, and `docker network ls` to list all Docker resources.
2. **Remove Orphaned Resources:** Remove orphaned resources using Docker commands such as `docker rm`, `docker volume rm`, and `docker network rm`.
   ```bash
   docker rm <container_id>
   docker volume rm <volume_name>
   docker network rm <network_name>
   ```
