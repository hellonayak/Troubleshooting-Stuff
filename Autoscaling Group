Alert: Instance <instance_id> in autoscaling group <autoscaling_group_name> is unhealthy.
```

**Problem Description:**
An unhealthy instance within an autoscaling group can result in service disruptions or performance degradation for the associated application or service.

**Solution:**
1. **Identify Unhealthy Instance:** Use instance health checks or monitoring metrics to identify the specific instance that is marked as unhealthy within the autoscaling group.
