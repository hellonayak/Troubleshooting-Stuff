2. **Review State Locking Service:** If using a remote backend with a locking service (e.g., DynamoDB for AWS S3 backend), check the status and configuration of the locking service.
3. **Retry Operation:** Attempt to re-run the Terraform command after resolving any issues with state locking. If necessary, manually release stale locks using the locking service's management console or CLI.

**Alert Scenario 4: Terraform Destroy Confirmation**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Terraform Destroy Confirmation Required

Alert: Terraform destroy command execution requires confirmation for infrastructure destruction.
```

**Problem Description:**
Terraform execution is paused due to the need for confirmation before applying destructive changes, such as resource deletion.

**Solution:**
1. **Review Planned Changes:** Use the `terraform plan` command to review planned changes and assess the impact of resource destruction.
2. **Confirm Destruction:** If the planned changes are acceptable, execute the `terraform destroy` command with the `-auto-approve` flag to bypass confirmation prompts.
   ```bash
   terraform destroy -auto-approve
   ```
3. **Verify Destruction:** After destruction, verify that resources have been successfully deleted by inspecting the cloud provider's console or CLI.

**Alert Scenario 5: Terraform Backend Configuration Error**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Terraform Backend Configuration Error

Alert: Terraform encountered errors while configuring backend for state storage.
```

**Problem Description:**
Terraform fails to initialize or configure the backend for storing state files, preventing proper state management and coordination between team members.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Backend Configuration:** Verify the backend configuration in the Terraform configuration files (e.g., `backend.tf`) for errors or misconfigurations.
2. **Verify Backend Access:** Ensure that Terraform has proper permissions and access to the backend storage (e.g., AWS S3 bucket, Azure Blob Storage).
3. **Test Backend Connection:** Test the connection to the backend storage manually using the appropriate CLI or API tools to verify connectivity and permissions.

**Alert Scenario 6: Terraform Module Resolution Error**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Terraform Module Resolution Error

Alert: Terraform encountered errors while resolving modules in the configuration.
```

**Problem Description:**
Terraform fails to resolve module dependencies or download module sources from the specified module registry, preventing successful execution.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Module References:** Verify module references in the Terraform configuration files (e.g., `main.tf`) to ensure they point to valid module sources.
2. **Review Module Versions:** If using versioned modules, ensure that the specified versions are available in the module registry or repository.
3.

 **Test Module Resolution:** Manually attempt to download module sources using the `terraform get` command to verify that module resolution is working as expected.

**Alert Scenario 7: Terraform State Corruption**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Terraform State Corruption Detected

Alert: Terraform state files are corrupted or inconsistent, affecting infrastructure management.
```

**Problem Description:**
The Terraform state files, which store the state of managed infrastructure, have become corrupted or inconsistent due to manual modifications, concurrent access issues, or storage errors.

**Solution:**
1. **Restore from Backup:** If available, restore a backup copy of the Terraform state files from a known good state.
2. **Manual Repair:** Attempt manual repair of the state files by removing or correcting any corrupted data or inconsistencies. This should be done cautiously and with a thorough understanding of the state file structure.
3. **Reinitialize State:** If repair is not feasible, reinitialize the Terraform state from scratch using the `terraform init` command and reapply infrastructure changes.

**Alert Scenario 8: Terraform Provider Version Compatibility**

**Alert Notification:**
```
Subject: ALERT - Terraform Provider Version Compatibility Issue

Alert: Terraform provider version used in the configuration is incompatible or deprecated.
```

**Problem Description:**
The version of a Terraform provider used in the configuration is incompatible with the Terraform version or deprecated, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior during execution.

**Solution:**
